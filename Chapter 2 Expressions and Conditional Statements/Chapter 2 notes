**Chapter 2 - Expressions and Conditional Statements**
A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value written literally is an expression
eg. 77 or "Jayesh".

**Operators in Javascript**

1) **Arithmetic Operators**
+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
**  Exponentiation
/   Division
%   Modulus
++  Increment
--  Decrement

2) **Assignment Operators**
=   x=y
+=  x=x+y
-=  x=x-y
*=  x=x*y
/=  x=x/y
%=  x=x%y
**= x=x**y

3) **Comparison Operators
==  equal to
!=  not equal
=== equal value and datatype
!== not equal values and not equal type
>   greater than
<   less than
>=  greater than equal to
<=  less than equal to
?   ternary Operator

4) **Logical Operators**
&&  logical and
||  logical not
!   logical not

- Apart from these, we also have type and bitwise operators. Bitwise operators perform bit by bit operations of numbers.

**Comments in JavaScript**
- Sometimes we want out programs to contain a text which is not executed by the JS engine.
- Such a text is called comment in JavaScript.
- A comment in JavaScript can be written as follows:

let a = 2;  //This is single line Comment

/*
I am a 
multiline comment
*/

- Sometimes comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code.

let switch = true;
// switch = false;  => Commented line won't execute.

**Conditional Statements**
- Sometimes we might have to execute a block of code based off some condition.
- For example, a prompt might ask for the age of the user and if its greater than 18, display a special message.
- In javascript we have three forms of if...else statement
1) if statement
2) if...else statement
3) if...else if...else statement

**If statement**
- The if statement in javascript looks like this:

if(Condition){
    //execute this code
}

- The if statement evaluates the condition inside the ().
- If the condition is evaluated to true, the code inside the body of if is executed else the code is not executed.

**if...else statement**
- The if statement can have an optional else clause.
- The syntax looks something like this
if(condition){
    //block of code if condition is true
}
else{
    // block of code if condtition is false
}

- if the condition is true, code inside if is executed else code inside else block is executed.

**if...else if...else statement**
- sometimes we might want to keep recheking a set of conditions one by one until one matches.
- We use if elseif for achieving this.
- Syntax of if...elseif looks like this

if(age>0){
    consol.log("A valid age")
}else if(age>10 %% age<18){
    console.log("You are a kid")
}else if(age>18){
    console.log("You are an adult")
}else{
    consol.log("invalid age")
}

**Javascript Ternary Operator**
- Evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

Condition ? exp1: exp2

Example:-

(marks>10)?'Yes':'No'
